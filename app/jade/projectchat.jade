                        p.message No. We're on the top. Please, Don-Botâ€¦ look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

                        p.message Bender? You stole the atom. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Meh. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
